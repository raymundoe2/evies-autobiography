<ul>
<li>My majour is Biochemistry and I’m minoring in American Sign Language.</li>
<li>I wish to be a Medical Technician and Medical Interpreter, and after a few years working and studying, I hope to be a Cosmetic Chemist</li>
<li>I’m currently studying American Sign Language, and wish for (one of) my future careers to be an ASL interpreter! Whether it be for a hospital, for a concert, a school. I enjoy it so much, sometimes I even play an ASL word search on my phone/iPad: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/asl-word-search/id700338219">ASL Word Search</a></li>
<li>I’m one of the first generation americans in my family, my brothers and parents were born in the Philippines</li>
<li>I’m still learning tagalog, I can understand but sometimes I struggle speaking it: I struggle the most reading and writing it.</li>
<li>I love collecting Skullpandas, a blind box figure from PopMart. (If you've heard of Labubus, they're from the same "store") My current favourites are the Image of Reality and the Mirage set. <a href="https://www.popmart.com/us/collection/2/skullpanda">Skullpandas</a> </li>
<li>I have a gaming pc, although I’m not really good at gaming. I’m one of those people who just play Sims, Osu, or other cozy games you could think of, but if my friends need an extra teammate, I’m always there. This is the PC I bought for Christmas! <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/684526/powerspec-g521-gaming-pc">Powerspec G521</a></li>
<li>I do my own nails and my hair! I’m not amazing at it, I didn’t go to school for it (sadly) but I find it fun and is my biggest (and arguably, most expensive) hobby, here are a few that I've done: </li>
